        <h2>Biography</h2>
        <img src="images/freeman-portrait.jpg" alt=morgan/>
        <div id="biography">
            <p class="green">With an authoritative voice and calm demeanor, this ever popular American actor has grown into one of the most
                respected figures in modern US cinema. Morgan was born on <em>June 1, 1937</em> in Memphis, Tennessee, to
                Mayme Edna (Revere), a teacher, and Morgan Porterfield Freeman, a barber. The young Freeman attended <em><strong> Los Angeles City College</strong></em>                before serving several years in the US Air Force as a mechanic between 1955 and 1959. His first dramatic
                arts exposure was on the stage including appearing in an all-African American production of the exuberant
                musical Hello, Dolly!.
            </p>
            <p class="blue"> Freeman first appeared on TV screens as several characters including "Easy Reader", "Mel Mounds" and "Count Dracula"
                on the Children's Television Workshop (now Sesame Workshop) show The Electric Company (1971). He then moved
                into feature film with another children's adventure, <span class="unseen">Who Says I Can't Ride</span> a Rainbow! (1971). Next, there
                was a small role in the thriller Blade (1973); then he played Casca in Julius Caesar (1979) and the title
                role in <span class="seen">Coriolanus (1979)</span>. Regular work was coming in for the talented Freeman and he appeared in the prison
                dramas Attica (1980) and Brubaker (1980), Eyewitness (1981), and portrayed the final 24 hours of slain Malcolm
                X in Death of a Prophet (1981). For most of the 1980s, Freeman continued to contribute decent enough performances
                in films that fluctuated in their quality. However, he really stood out, scoring an <a href="http://oscar.go.com/ ">Oscar </a>                nomination as a merciless hoodlum in Street Smart (1987) and, then, he dazzled audiences and pulled a second
                Oscar nomination in the film version of <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/driving_miss_daisy" target="movies">Driving Miss Daisy</a>                (1989) opposite <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001788/">Jessica Tandy.</a> The same year, Freeman teamed
                up with youthful Matthew Broderick and fiery Denzel Washington in the epic Civil War drama <a href="pages/glory.html">Glory</a>                (1989) about freed slaves being recruited to form the first all-African American fighting brigade.
